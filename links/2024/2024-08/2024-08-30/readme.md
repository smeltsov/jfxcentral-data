## Applications

* **Frank Delporte** got challenged by his 14-year-old son **Vik** to create an app to _look at music_: "Vik hopes to become rich, while I took it as a challenge to learn more about MIDI and make my first Kotlin application. There is still much work to do, but I just [published this video with a status update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR4PL8ufiDw). More info is on [melodymatrix.rocks](https://melodymatrix.rocks/)." Some parts of the code is [opensource on GitHub](https://github.com/codewriterbv/melodymatrix-app-views).

Check the full thread for more info about combining Quarkus and JavaFX.
* [**OrangoMango** shared a video](https://x.com/orango_mango/status/1819694644612972606): "Solar system simulation made in Java with the JavaFX framework.
